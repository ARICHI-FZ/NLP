# Project Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of an educational project focusing on data processing and text parsing using Python. One of the highlights of this project is the utilization of a pre-trained GloVe model tailored for Arabic text data to enhance linguistic analyses.

## Notebooks Description

### Lab_2_1.ipynb

#### Functionality
The notebook `Lab_2_1.ipynb` includes Python code designed to parse textual data describing products purchased, their quantities, and prices. It extracts this information using regular expressions and generates a detailed bill.

#### Features
- **Regex-based text parsing**: Extracts product details from structured text.
- **Bill generation**: Calculates total prices and prints a detailed bill with product names, quantities, unit prices, and total costs.


### Lab_2_2.ipynb

Welcome to the Arabic Text Processing Project repository! This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze and process Arabic text. The notebooks utilize Python and a pre-trained GloVe model specifically tailored for the Arabic corpus.

## Installation

To run these notebooks:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure that Python 3 and Jupyter are installed on your machine.
3. If necessary, download and set up the pre-trained GloVe model for Arabic:
